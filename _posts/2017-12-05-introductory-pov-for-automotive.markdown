In this brief I'll discuss how both quality- and asset management can be improved in todays data-rich environment.

For as long as the targets haven't changed one may see no reason for change of the methodology to reach them. But the mere fact that we are presented with the same questions does not mean the old answers still suffice. If crossing an ocean is your goal it is still transport that you seek. However you would choose todays methods and you would want to make use of modern tools and infrastructure.

For Physical Asset Managment and Quality in Manufacturing this is no different.

## Developments that affect the concrete manufacturing industry:

Area | Gamechanging Development
--- | ---
Mobile  | Distributed and Moving is no longer an information issue
(Cloud) Storage | Close to zero coordination cost due to plummeted  cost of storage and sharing makes cross industry optimisation viable.
Analytics | Machine learning technology and computing power allows for multi dimensional & hypothesis-free statistical analysis.
Communities | Technologies now allow for the participation in a array of communities for coordinated optimisation.
One-off production technology | Although in its infantry, consumers expect product customisation for near-zero additional cost.
Machine to Machine | peer to peer communication to orchestrate optimisation such as peak shaving, collision avoidance and flow management.
Robotics | Sensor technology and force-sensitive movement allow for up-close collaboration between humans and machines.

### Enabling:

Objective | Result
--- | ---
Intelligent Production  |  Combining product state & process data to improve quality. Allow for customisation and decentralised productionlines ,  *(this calls for a revised concept of physical production facilities)*
Cognitive Maintenance  |  Continuously improve the knowledge on the state of the asset *(risk of failure)* to improve the intervention rules at every business cycle.
Smart Energy  |  Moving energy consumption and production data into the public domain to allow for price driven demand.

## Business Today

Now what does this mean for a **Operations Manager** and a **Maintenance Chief** who allready run a highly robotised plant that spits out a mid-size truck-frame every hour.

### Use of Machine & Process Data
In earlier times (total quality or six-sigma) the breadth of variables needed to be deminished to surface the relation between material specs, recepies, machine settings, handling manner and enviromental influences. With todays data gathering capabilities and analytical tooling one does not need to put pad-locks on dials to flesh out the causal relationships.

Todays data-infrastructure can easily capture **Multidimensional Variation** and it is actually desirable from a analytical point of view.
>This does not mean that there is no longer a need to run a taught ship : putting a padlock on dials that only have one right setting still makes good sense.

Todays **Machine Learning** techniques can derive knowledge out of a multidimensional dataset *(with up to a 1000 variables)*. The thus found relations can be used to predict quality scores. Hereby production boundaries can improved and compensatory actions designed.

The power lies in combining data all along the different stages in the production process on:
- Process parameters
- Machine state, and
- Product state

## Hurdles to take

### How to relate to product ?
In order to succesfully combine the date derived from Process, Machine and Product State data needs to be 'related'. First and formemost that means that the product, parts, materials are traced throughout the process.  Todays data gathering capabilty not only allows for per item registration but to succesfully isolate **quality- (product) or state (asset) determining factors** this is key. *Something that may traditionally not have been there in commidity productionlines.*

### Subjective (non) Quality assesment
In order to do multi-dimensional analysis of the relation between sensory data, production data, material specs, objectified quality assessment is needed. Here modern sensors and Machine Learned Optical Recognition can help out. But upgrading current reporting tools to allow for quantative data collection could allready be a good startingpoint.

### Capability to create insights from data

### Capabilty to turn insights into action

Please realise that if an organisation is not able to act upon the information it has at hand today; It shall probably not perform much better with enhanced data agragation, state of machine/product monitoring and advanced analytics. In fact people may act even more **reactive** than before. While what your want is **adaptive planning** based on better knowledge. Keeping your **production schedule** and **maintenance interventions predictable** and **cost effective**.

![Image: Benefits Logic](https://fprisse.github.io/Digital_for_Industry/images/Automotive_Benefits.PNG)
A solid basis to work from is needed in terms of:
- Documented maintenance regime per asset catagory
- Basic schedule of inspections and overhauls
- Registration of diversions from planning
- Catagorized intermediate interventions
- Quantified reporting of inspections

In operations:
- Registration (sensored) of machine configuration
- Registration of operator interventions

## Investments to make:
Improve sensoring and datacapture on machines: Machines today (heritage) are often only equiped by sensors that are needed to steer or that signal out-of-bounds values (while today we want short interval data to feed into product & condition monitoring).

Data capturing from human- assesment and interventions through mobile device based activity registration.

Key here is to determine what are core technologies and capabilities and what are (or will be) commodity activities.

eg. Core:
- Objective quality assessment
- Everything connected to product differentiating technology & processes
- Operational safety

eg. None core
- Data agragation
- Connectivity
- Advanced Analysitics
- Privacy & IT Cybersecurity
