# Digital manufacturing: The revolution will be virtualized

​By  Brian Hartmann, William P. King, and Subu Narayanan

Few manufacturers are responding to opportunities and threats  presented by the digital revolution in a comprehensive, coordinated  way. Learn how and why manufacturing industries require a digital  transformation.

**The digital revolution** is now breaching the  walls of manufacturing as it continues to disrupt media, finance,  consumer products, healthcare, and other sectors. Indeed, the explosion  in data and new computing capabilities—along with advances in other  areas such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, additive  technology, and human-machine interaction—are unleashing innovations  that will change the nature of manufacturing itself. Industry and  academic leaders agree that [digital-manufacturing technologies](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/manufacturings-next-act) will transform every link in the [manufacturing value chain](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/digitizing-the-value-chain),  from research and development, supply chain, and factory operations to  marketing, sales, and service. Digital connectivity among designers,  managers, workers, consumers, and physical industrial assets will unlock  enormous value and change the manufacturing landscape forever.

Yet while manufacturing generates more data than any other sector of  the economy, few companies are harnessing it. One oil-and-gas company,  for example, discards 99 percent of its data before decision makers have  a chance to use it. We believe that companies that can close this gap  by tapping the data they generate (and what’s publicly available) will  uncover valuable insights to drive profits and growth. Consider  traditional car manufacturers and Uber, which are both—at the highest  level—in the business of moving people around. Car makers meet that need  on the floors of factories and showrooms, using a century of  manufacturing experience. Uber meets people’s transportation needs not  with steel, glass, rubber, and salespeople but with data, matching  individual riders and vehicles via smart phones. Barely five years into  its existence, it is valued at about $50 billion. Uber’s data,  algorithms, and enormous growth prospects have already made it more  valuable than all of the physical assets, intellectual property, and  brand names of some of the world’s biggest car manufacturers.

It comes as no surprise, then, that manufacturers are waking up to  the opportunities and threats of digitization. In the United States, the  National Network for Manufacturing Innovation is organizing six major  research institutes to speed new manufacturing technologies to market.  While all of these institutes have a digital component, one is focused  specifically on digital manufacturing.[1](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/digital-manufacturing-the-revolution-will-be-virtualized#)   Similar efforts are underway across the globe, including Germany’s  Industry 4.0 effort and China’s Made in China 2025. One global convening  organization, the Industrial Internet Consortium, was founded just 18  months ago and already has 175 members.

## How leading manufacturers are responding to digital

The ways people and organizations use information has shifted  dramatically. Data storage is cheap and flexible, and advanced analytics  and artificial intelligence are giving us new abilities to draw  insights from large amounts of data. Advances in virtual and augmented  reality, next-level interfaces, advanced robotics, and additive  manufacturing are all opening the gates to digital disruption. And in  the next decade, digital manufacturing technologies will allow companies  to connect physical assets by a “digital thread”—unleashing a seamless  flow of data across the value chain that will link every phase of the  product life cycle, from design, sourcing, testing, and production to  distribution, point of sale, and use.

While this digital transformation of the $10-trillion-plus global  manufacturing sector will play out over a decade or more, pioneers are  moving to drive bottom-line and top-line impact in the near term. When  we examine manufacturing value drivers and map them to digital levers,  we find several opportunities for companies to create value by improving  operational effectiveness and product innovation, as well as by  unlocking new sources of revenue.[2](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/digital-manufacturing-the-revolution-will-be-virtualized#)  Some examples include the following:

- Many large manufacturers are starting to use data analytics to  optimize factory operations, boosting equipment utilization and product  quality while reducing energy consumption. With new supply-network  management tools, factory managers have a clearer view of raw materials  and manufactured parts flowing through a manufacturing network, which  can help them schedule factory operations and product deliveries to cut  costs and improve efficiency. Smart, connected products are sending  customer experience data to product managers to help them anticipate  demand and maintenance needs and design better products. Players in a  wide range of industries are deploying digital technologies in different  ways to drive value.

  A major metal plant, for example, has used digital tools to make  step-change improvements in throughput. Real-time performance  visualization in operator pulpits combined with daily problem solving  led to a 50 percent increase in production rate in one of its lines. By  mining data, engineers are gaining **new insights into the failure  characteristics of major equipment modes** and making continuous  improvements in reliability. The company expects to use **condition  monitoring and predictive maintenance, in conjunction with process  controls and automated material tracking** made possible with big data  analysis, to drive a 30 percent increase in production without a  substantial increase in operational costs.

- Pharmaceutical manufacturers are using their **deeper  understanding of end-to-end processes** to develop continuous  manufacturing suites with footprints less than half the size of  conventional factories. Some have even developed portable factories that  can be built in 40-foot trailers. They are also **using the digital  thread to improve quality control**: **continuously monitoring conditions**  within mixing vessels, tablet presses, lyophilizers, and other critical  equipment. A few companies are now relying on infrared technology to  detect counterfeit medicines and contaminants without the conventional  destructive tests—at production-line speeds. As the industry brings  these advances to the market, *leaders will transform the Three Sigma industry performance to peer industry performance of Six Sigma or  greater*.

- Leading consumer-packaged-goods companies are using digital  tools to improve distribution and build bonds with consumers. Global  fashion retailer Zara is already renowned for developing and shipping  new products within two weeks. It is now using digital tools to respond  even faster to consumer preferences and reduce supply-chain costs,  attaching reusable radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags to every  item of clothing in more than 700 of its 2,000-plus stores. Ten staff  members can now update a store’s inventory in a couple of hours—work  that used to take 40 employees more than five hours—by waving small  handheld computers at racks of clothing. The retailer expects to  complete the shift to wireless inventory in 2016. We believe the falling  costs of RFID hardware and associated software are likely to aid this  transition.

- The aerospace-and-defense industry is using digital tools to  integrate an enormously complex supply network. A modern jet turbine  engine has hundreds of individual parts, for example, some of which the  engine manufacturer makes in-house and others it sources from a network  of dozens of vendors. The complexity of sourcing can multiply quickly,  since making one design modification can impact the manufacturing of  many other components. Cloud computing–based tools allow suppliers to  collaborate faster and more efficiently: an engine maker can share  three-dimensional models of component design within its network, and  each supplier in turn can share information about price, delivery, and  quality. This type of information sharing and transparency reduces the  labor required to manage design changes, reduces risk for the engine  maker and suppliers, and speeds changes across the supply network.  Boeing developed its two most recent airframes, for the 777 and 787,  using all-virtual design, reducing time to market by more than 50  percent.

## Questions about digital the C-suite should ask

The digital revolution is only beginning to take shape. But we do  know that leaders in digital manufacturing, including some smaller  players, are already gaining significant competitive advantage by  harnessing the capabilities of workers, designers, managers, and  suppliers, speeding the pace of innovation, lowering the costs of  production and maintenance, and increasing the impact of marketing. We  believe that every player should be asking five questions:

1. How will digital disrupt my industry in the next five to ten years, and what new ecosystems will emerge?
2. Where is the value for my company, and how can we maximize it?
3. How close is the revolution to our factory doors, and where  should I make investments in infrastructure, cybersecurity, and  partnerships?
4. What new capabilities, skills, and mind-sets will we need in our  organization? How will we identify, recruit, and retain the right new  talent?
5. What should we pilot now to start capturing this value?

------

No company has harnessed every possible digital advance, but many  have begun to make real progress. One thing seems certain: in  marketplaces where profit margins are thin and consumers demand ever  more sophisticated products and better service, the digital thread will  lead some companies to great success while slow-moving competitors fall  further behind.
