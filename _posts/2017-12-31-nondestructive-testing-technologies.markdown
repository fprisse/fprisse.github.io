# Nondestructive Testing Technology

**Nondestructive Testing (NDT)**  consists of a variety of non-invasive inspection techniques used to  evaluate material properties, components, or entire process units. The  techniques can also be utilized to detect, characterize, or measure the  presence of [**damage mechanisms**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/damage+mechanisms) (e.g. corrosion or [**cracks**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/cracking)).  NDT is also commonly referred to as nondestructive examination (NDE),  nondestructive evaluation (NDE), and nondestructive inspection (NDI).  Many NDT techniques are capable of locating defects and determining the  features of the defects such as size, shape, and orientation. The  purpose of NDT is to inspect a component in a safe, reliable, and cost  effective manner without causing damage to the equipment or shutting  down plant operations. This is in contrast to destructive testing where  the part being tested is damaged or destroyed during the inspection  process.

NDT can be performed during or after  manufacture, or even on equipment that is in service. In manufacturing,  NDT inspections determine if parts are fit for a desired function. In  other words, parts are inspected to ensure they will last a certain  amount of time or cycles before failure. During operation, NDT  inspections can be used to asses the current damage state of equipment,  monitor damage mechanisms, and make informed decisions for remaining  equipment life evaluations (e.g., [**RBI**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/risk-based+inspection), [**FFS**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/fitness+for+service)).

## Overview of NDT Methods

NDT methods can generally be  classified into two categories: conventional and advanced. Each method  has its own characteristic advantages and limitations. More information  on each test can be found in their respective Integripedia definitions.

#### **Conventional NDT Techniques**

Conventional methods are techniques  that have matured over the course of decades and in this time, have  become well-documented in codes, standards, and best practices. The  setup and procedure of a conventional technique is typically simpler in  comparison to advanced methods.

- **Acoustic Emission Testing** (AET)
- **Infrared Testing** (IR)
- Leak Testing (LT)
- **Liquid Penetrant Testing** (PT)
- Electromagnetic Testing (ET)
- **Magnetic Particle Testing** (MPT)
- **Radiographic Testing** (RT)
- Film Radiography (FR)
- **Ultrasonic Testing** (UT)
- Straight Beam
- Vibration Analysis (VA)
- **Visual Inspection** (VI)

#### **Advanced NDT Techniques**

Advanced methods tend to be less  understood as they progress as emerging technologies, e.g. uncertain  advantages or limitations, lack of technician qualification criteria, or  little to no industry codification. Generally, the setup, procedure,  and data interpretation of advanced methods is more complicated and can  require specialized understanding and experience from a properly trained  technician.

Furthermore, some methods can be  further broken down into conventional and advanced techniques. Take two  forms of ultrasonic testing for example, straight beam ultrasonic  testing (UT) is a conventional technique used in simple applications  whereas phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) is an advanced UT  technique. As advanced techniques mature, new and more advanced versions  of each emerge to start a new cycle of technical understanding and  technician training.

  - Time-of-Flight-Diffraction (TOFD)

Overall, NDT offers many advantages  compared to destructive testing. The testing equipment is often portable  and can be performed numerous times on a single component. The  component itself can be thoroughly evaluated externally and internally  for harmful flaws. The disadvantage is that the results are often  qualitative and may be repeated and interpreted differently by various  inspectors.

## Industry Applications of NDT

NDT inspections are an integral part  of the oil and gas and petrochemical industries, along with several  other industries, including chemicals, aerospace, automotive, and  defense. The overall goal of all these industries is to detect flaws in  components to reduce failure and increase reliability.

In the petrochemical industry, NDT  inspections are utilized throughout a facility’s lifecycle. This  cradle-to-grave approach is an important element of [**asset integrity management**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/asset+integrity+management). Furthermore, NDT  inspections provide historical data about the facility’s process units  and provide information on how often a component should be inspected,  repaired, or replaced. Inspection intervals and tests may be changed  depending on where the equipment is in its life-cycle (e.g. newly  manufactured equipment vs. aging equipment). Performing multiple  assessments throughout the equipment’s life-cycle may seem expensive.  However, inspections conducted at specific intervals may end up saving  an organization millions of dollars if testing reveals threats and  equipment is repaired before shutting down the facility or experiencing a  catastrophic failure.

The most common pieces of equipment  that undergo inspection in the petrochemical industry are storage tanks,  heat exchangers, pressure vessels, and piping systems. When planning an  NDT inspection, there are four considerations one should account for:

1. The type of damage mechanism to be inspected for
2. The minimum detectable flaw size, shape, and orientation of the defect
3. Where the defect is located (surface or internal)
4. The sensitivities and limitations of the NDT method

With the above factors considered, operators can optimize facility production and increase personnel and environmental safety.

## Codes and Standards Bodies

NDT is often prescribed by [**codes and standards**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/codes+and+standards) for  the fabrication of components, safety critical parts, and in-service  equipment. Therefore, it is critical for all refinery, chemical plant,  gas plant, and pipeline owners to  have thorough understanding and experience in the interdisciplinary  field of NDT. In addition to the factors listed above (*Industry Application section*) personnel should continuously develop knowledge about evolving technology and performing up-to-date procedures.

Specific codes, standards,  specifications, regulations, and recommended practices may depend on the  country and industry performing NDT. The following is a list of  organizations (standards bodies) that develop and publish industrial  codes, standards, and recommended practices for NDT methods relating to  the oil and gas and chemical processing industries:

- [**The American Society for Nondestructive Testing**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/asnt) (ASNT)
- **ASTM International**
- [**American Society of Mechanical Engineers**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/asme) (ASME)
- [**American Petroleum Institute**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/api) (API)
- [**American Welding Society**](https://inspectioneering.com/tag/aws) (AWS)

- European Pressure Equipment Directive (PED)

A complete list of  regulations created by the U.S. government may be found in the Code of  Federal Regulations (CFR). Regulations critical to the petrochemical and  chemical processing industries can be found under Title 10, Energy, and  Title 49, Transportation.1

## Training and Certification

#### **Levels of Certification**

Many NDT programs have three levels of qualification. A brief  description of Level I, Level II, and Level III qualifications are  outlined below and found in the ASNT Recommended Practice No. SNT-TC-1A  document.2

Level I: At the end of a Level I certification program, individuals  should be able to perform specific calibrations, specific NDT, and  specific evaluations to determine if a component should be accepted or  rejected for service.

Level II: Level II individuals should have the same abilities as  Level I individuals and additionally, should be able to set-up,  calibrate, perform, and evaluate NDT results with respect to applicable  codes, standards, and specifications.

Level III: The highest qualified level of NDT personnel should have  the same abilities as Level II individuals and additionally, be able to  develop and qualify procedures, establish and approve techniques,  interpret codes, standards, specifications and procedures, and assign  particular NDT methods to use in specific applications.

#### **Certification Requirements**

Requirements are based on a combination of training, examination, and  experience. Training is based on an accumulation of training course  outlines from the NDT Body of Knowledge document. More detail on the  ASNT NDT Body of Knowledge can be found in the ANSI/ASNT American  National Standard CP-105. The purpose of the Body of Knowledge is to  describe the knowledge and skills needed for different levels of  certification. Several types of examinations are also necessary to meet  minimum requirements and to recertify. Individuals may have to take a  written exam, specific exam, or a practical exam depending on the  certification desired. Experience in NDT or NDT-related fields as well  as on-the-job training programs are also considered for certification.
