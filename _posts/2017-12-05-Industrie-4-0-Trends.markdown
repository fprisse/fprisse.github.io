An introductory reading: A short summary of developments deemed relevant for the topic at hand. Covered here are Smart Factories, Smart Energy & Cognitive Maintenance.

## 1 - Smart Factories:
Decentralized manufacturing systems calls for a revised concept of physical production facilities

### Decentralized manufacturing systems
- Increased Manufacturing complexity
- Decreased production volume per product variant
- Material flow determined by a de-central decision making process (auction, market etc.)

### Severe consequences in factory design
- Must allow for Individual & non dedicated material flows
- Shop in shop model
**Production scheduling:** increased flexibility is needed to allow for utilization of information about the systems current state for adoption of production schedules, inventory reduction/resource optimisation /
**Human - Robot collaboration**
- Higher complexity & flexibility is handled at workstations: repetitive work is replaced by fast changing situations
- No longer constant **cycle times**
- Changes in capacity (no of workers) per workstation
- Human robot shared workplace; connected sensors and advanced control software allow the implementation of assisting robots in assembly tasks (todays robots are working in separate cells for safety reasons)
- Force sensitive (reactive) movements: use of robots for non-predetermined movements
Optimal positioning of manufacturing cells: a different outcome of local vs global assessment
- Relatively larger material handling component; projected to rise to an 20% - 50% of total production cost (depending on industry)
- Expected growth in energy / emission cost  


_More then before there is a need to include ‘Competitors’ for Resources, human interface designers, technology and process contractors in the ‘circle of trust’_

## 2 - Smart Energy:
Moving energy consumption and production data into the public domain to allow for price driven demand

### Smart Energy Networks:
- End-to-end and bidirectional delivery of both energy and information
- Energy is generated at traditional facilities as well as in distributed (co-) generation facilities.
- Information covering every aspect of electricity from generation to consumption will also be conveyed or available in the public domain

### Participation in a smart grid network
- Predictability of position (self and others)
- Contribution to optimising the network as a whole gets higher reward than ‘playing the game’
- Able to act on the state of the network (adaptive machinery)

### Benefit
- Smaller overall investment: serve more with less: production facilities and distributive network
- Cost : Consume Less & Lower unit cost
- License to operate: Less emissions
- Profitable of selling of surplus:  Warmth in local network & Electricity (converted)

### Desirable Network:
Cross industry, local usage- and production information. Resulting in reduced capacity in production and conversion facilities through **peak shaving** and savings due to successful **trading of waste energy**

## 3 - Cognitive Maintenance:
Continuously **improve business rules** to upgrade quality of analysis and risk assessment.

Gather and make available production- and condition data using cheap sensoring, connectivity, storage and sharing technologies
Using all relevant data and field knowledge to assess **he probability of failure**.  
 ``(already used in aviation, example; Air frame inspection frequencies are adjusted conform flight recording data. This requires a lot of data from different sources. Due to strict regulations data matching has been a relative small problem)
``

The industry (and it’s contractors, such as CapGemini) needs to integrate its disciplines
- Operational Excellence: OEE, process improvement
- Maintenance: process management, execution, analytics
- Data science: simulation, data handling (Integral solution for data matching)
and thus build a network and infrastructure for multi-dimensional clustering of information

Jointly with quality control evolve maintenance into the science of **Product Quality and State of the Asset Managagement**
1. Continuously upgrade quality of analysis to better asses likelyhood of non-quality and unplanned downtime
2. In business cycles ammend the rules to realise better quality and longer uptime intervals

_Industrial players need to form alliances to share development cost of collection and availability of device data and intelligent engines_

## Investement consequences

Fast commercialisation and commoditization
Implementation capability rather than proprietary  knowledge

Need to invest in the capability to leverage technology available in the public domain

## Wake up call
_SOURCE: The diplomat, May 21, 2015, Yanfei Li: Industry 4.0 and Energy 4.0 for Southeast Asia_

South Asian countries are more blunt in describing todays challenge:
“We do not need to be the territory where technologies for Intelligent production , Clean Energy , Green industries are developed”
“We must however be the territory where ready to be commercialized and commoditised technologies can be encorporated first

Hereby following China’s example in their success in the manufacturing of: low-cost solar photovoltaics, Wind turbines , Smartphones, Robotic equipment by combining mature technologies with competitive production factors (eg cheap labor, land availability, cheap energy)

Furthermore a more centrally steered economy allowed for compulsary technology sharing and reasignemnet of assets & resources.
