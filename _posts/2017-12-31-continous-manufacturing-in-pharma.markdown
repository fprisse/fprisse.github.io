# True Continuous Manufacturing

It’s time to replace the pharma industry’s conventional batch-based processing with efficient, true continuous manufacturing.

**CONSIDER THESE STATISTICS**:

- Drug recalls have grown at an [alarming rate](http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2014/08/11/20005/Number-of-Drug-Recalls-Surges-at-FDA-Led-by-Mid-Level-Concerns/).  The last three years have seen almost as many recalls as the previous  nine years combined. Contamination during the manufacturing process  being one of the biggest contributors.
- [$50 billion/year losses](https://source.wustl.edu/2006/10/pharmaceutical-industry-wastes-50-billion-a-year-due-to-inefficient-manufacturing/) in manufacturing costs from inefficient processes.
- [According to the FDA](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/default.cfm), ~300 drugs are currently in [short supply](http://www.time.com/3655660/usdrug-shortage/).

The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry has remained with  batch processes, backed by rigorous testing at each stage (Figure 1),  for well over 50 years, especially when it comes to the preparation of  solid oral dosage forms. It has relied heavily on standard operating  procedures and process control without being able to solve the  fundamental issue — variability in end-point of a typical batch process  that can only be controlled by the subjective intervention of a human  operator. Statistics, like the ones listed above, indicate that  pharmaceutical manufacturing cannot afford to have any controls that are  subjective and variable.

Continuous processing could lend itself to solve the end-point  variability and free the “process” from operator dependence. That said,  continuous process can be exploited by the pharma industry if and only  if certain prerequisites are maintained.

Continuous manufacturing practiced in several industries (not related  to pharmaceuticals) is typically associated with wide Residence Time  Distribution (RTD) due to back flow and stagnation, with inherent risk  of quality and control. As such, continuous manufacturing is employed to  achieve economics — as in gourmet vs. mass production of food products.

In the pharmaceutical industry, some manufacturers employ highly  automated batch processing in lieu of continuous manufacturing  considering it as a superior option. In such instances, there continues  to be multiple batch operations such as fluid bed drying linked via  automatic transfer systems with these unit operations still needing  individual control and monitoring at each stage (Figure 2). Operator  intervention is tried to be replaced by on-line measurements for  determination of end-point. However, neither automated batch processing  nor wide RTD continuous manufacturing or a combination of the two is  suitable for wide-scale adoption in the field of pharmaceutical  manufacturing. The high degree of control required for maintaining  product quality can only be realized in a steady state and in the event  control is lost, the ability to deal intelligently with the product in  stream has severely restricted the application of continuous processing  in the pharmaceutical industry.

In other words, the pharmaceutical industry needs Next Generation  (21st Century) true continuous manufacturing that has certain unique  attributes that satisfy all of the requirements — regulatory and  quality, among others.

**A PARADIGM SHIFT: TRUE CONTINUOUS, SINGLE POT MANUFACTURING**
True  continuous, single pot manufacturing is built on the principle of a  “flow stream in continuity.” Utilizing a twin screw processor, that has a  unique ability to clean itself, true continuous manufacturing relies on  keeping the input, process material and output in a continuous flow,  with particles moving as a highly stratified process stream.
The  energy transfer is made effective using thermal, mechanical or chemical  means at wide-ranging magnitudes with minimal shear or pressure peaks  providing specific advantages in handling sensitive input materials that  may or may not rely on the use of water or vapor. Granulation process  can typically be achieved with residence time as little as 5-15 seconds  (including granulating, drying and sizing), and the optimized granules  obtained are ready to be compressed into tablets or filled into capsules  (Figure 3).

True continuous, single pot processing provides significant  improvement in building both temporal and spatial control in process  engineering through removal of hot spots and dead zones, while  maintaining higher level of process continuity. Another key aspect is  the principle of integration. All operations are integrated into a  single piece of equipment, hence the term ‘single-pot,’ minimizing the  need for human intervention. Raw materials are fed through one end and  end products adhering to clearly defined end-points come out of the  other.

Moreover, true continuous processing allows for a significantly  smaller footprint (due to integration), is flexible and versatile, and  can significantly reduce capital costs and wastage besides minimizing  the burden on the environment.

**IT'S TIME TO CHANGE**

# Specific Advantages  of True Continuous Processing

- Elimination of hot spots and dead zones
- Traceability (stratified continuous stream)
- The ability to maintain steady state of control
- Near complete delivery
- Versatility (easily adaptable to meet differentiated needs during process development)
- Quality by Design (well established risk and product quality)
- Economical development
- Ease of scalability (linear and non-linear)
- No metal dust contamination

The FDA is, in fact, urging manufacturers to shift to continuous processing for its numerous advantages, including flexibility, reliability and  scalability. But above all, the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry  faces a dire need to reduce its burden and shift its focus onto quality  manufacturing (QbD via well-established risk and product quality). True  continuous processing not only addresses the most fundamental concerns  relating to regulatory requirements and quality, but also provides  manufacturers with a significant reduction in capital and operating  costs, manufacturing footprint, wastage and downtime, while  significantly increasing the speed to market.
