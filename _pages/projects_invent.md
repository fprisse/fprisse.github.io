Factory Liason and Industry x0 Expert for FrieslandCampina's smartplant team: A use-case driven program to improve performance in the field of Asset Performace. Taking Asset Health and Quality statistics as a foundation we developed bespoke tools to adress prioritised issues in the field of material loss, quality, energy consumption and unplanned downtime. For this we combined in-cloud tools for exploratory analytics with sturdy on-premise implementations of our findings.

**2018 - 2020 : Practice lead Asset Performance Management**  
Design of the suite of solutions for data-driven Asset Management for Capgemini Group: This is done in close cooperation with our main customers and trusted suppliers. Based on our project experience in maintenance & asset management, we defined a cross-disciplinary approach to plan and execute the implementation of Asset Performance Management for our clients. This includes a step-by-step implementation programme covering asset registry, planning and execution tracking, condition monitoring and asset health analysitics.

**2017 : DSM Nutritional Products, Switzerland & India**  
DSM's centralised P2P organisation was struggling to serve DSM Nutritional Products (DNP) to satisfaction. Rather than fix the individual issues, we looked at the P2P workflow from a core-process perspective. Revealing (often easily realised) opportunities for a better match.

Asset performance management: Implemented analysis and reporting scheme of downtime in two regions (Randstad-Noord and Zuid) for the Dutch railway infrastructure; Befitting the performance contracts between ProRail and its contractors.

An introduction to business unit strategy: Designed course material and conducted training sessions for young consultants of the strategy and transformation discipline.

**2015 : ProRail, Netherlands**  
Prorail, proprietor of the Dutch railway infrastructure, was facing bad press due to dissatisfactory availability of the infrastructure around Schiphol. We conducted an extensive root-cause-analysis of downtime. Consecutively, based on our findings, we installed a daily planning and reporting workflow to optimise use of available nightly working hours. This included:
	⁃	Joint planning and scheduling with contractors for repairs
	⁃	Tracking of timely inspections and planned maintenance
	⁃	Isolate and escalate process for truly technical issues 
Thus, improving uptime by 21% within 3 months.

**2015 : Vopak Antwerpen, Belgium**  
As part of the integration of three chemical terminals, we aided in modelling the operational demand of current and projected business and thus formed the basis for a organisational re-fit in terms of job attribution and sizing. Consecutively we re-wrote the 5 year Asset Plan and drew up a future staffing plan.

**2014 : National Grid, United Kingdom**  
As part of implementing a new business model I was asked to revise their innovation strategy within the strict boundaries of the UK legislative framework for government funded research.

**2012 : Vopak Europoort, Netherlands**  
Opex reduction program for the Dutch terminals of Vopak.
	⁃	M&R: Reduced contractor cost by in-sourcing and improving planning and scheduling
	⁃	Ops: Reduced overtime and flex labour cost through improved labour demand prognosis
The success of this undertaking was mostly due to the non-isolated approach of above workstreams.
